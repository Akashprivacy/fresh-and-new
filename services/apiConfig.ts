NOTE FOR DEPLOYMENT:
This project setup does not include a build step (like Vite or Create React App) 
that would inject environment variables into the frontend.

Therefore, you must **manually** change the URL string above to your live backend URL 
(e.g., 'https://your-backend-app.onrender.com') before deploying the frontend.
